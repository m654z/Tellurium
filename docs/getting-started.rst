1. Getting started with Tellurium
*********************************

Tellurium, named after the element of the same name, is an esoteric programming language created by `m654 <http://m654z.github.io>`_. Tellurium is designed to be a code-golfing language.
so it tries to keep the code short. Because of all the one-character commands, Tellurium code might seem unreadable, but it is in fact quite easy to learn, once you can memorize what all
of the commands to.
Tellurium is a tape-based language, meaning that it uses a tape to store data in. Tellurium's tape has 25500 cells.

1.1 The interpreter
===================

Tellurium is an interpreted language, meaning that it uses an interpreter to run the code instead of a compiler. Tellurium's official interpreter is written in Python 3, so you'll need to
download it before you can start using Tellurium.
Once you have Tellurium's interpreter and Python 3, all you need to do is start up the program and start coding.

1.2 Hello!
==========

Let's start off this tutorial with a "Hello, world!" program. When you begin learning a new programming language, the first program you make is usually a simple program that says "Hello, world!".

	µHello, world!~^
	
Look confusing? It probably is, but let me explain.

* Everything after ``µ`` and before ``~`` will be read and stored in the selected cell.
* ``^`` outputs whatever is in the selected cell. In the above program, it's "Hello, world!"

Well, now that you've learned how to display text, let's move on to some more advanced topics.
